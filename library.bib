abstract = {During rupture, earthquakes induce permanent and dynamic ground displacements that can be measured by GPS. More than 1200 continuous GPS stations distributed throughout Japan recorded the displacements due to the March 11, 2011, Mw9.0 Tohoku-oki earthquake. We animate these data, which shows the growth of the earthquake rupture over time and illustrates differences of earthquake magnitude through two smaller aftershocks. We also identify dynamic ground motion due to S-waves (body waves), Love waves and Rayleigh waves (surface waves) in this data set. Real time availability of such displacements could be of great use in earthquake response and tsunami warning, and to some degree in earthquake early warning. We find that the length of the ruptured fault can be approximated from displacements which could allow rapid identification of areas prone to large aftershocks. We outline a method that integrates real time displacements into an earthquake alarm system. The animated displacements in map view are easily understandable by specialists and non-specialists alike and hence provide a valuable education and outreach tool.},

abstract = {We find strong correlation between seasonal variation in CGPS time series and predicted response to annual snow load in Iceland. The load is modeled using Green's functions for an elastic halfspace and a simple sinusoidal load history on Iceland's four largest ice caps. We derive E = 40 +/- 15 GPa as a minimum value for the effective Young's modulus in Iceland, increasing with distance from the Eastern Volcanic Zone. We calculate the elastic response over all of Iceland to maximum snow load at the ice caps using E = 40 GPa. Predicted annual vertical displacements are largest under the Vatnajokull ice cap with a peak-to-peak seasonal displacement of similar to 37 mm. CGPS stations closest to the ice cap experience a peak-to-peak seasonal displacement of similar to 16 mm, consistent with our model. East and north of Vatnajokull we find the maximum of annual horizontal displacements of similar to 6 mm resulting in apparent modulation of plate spreading rates in this area.},
